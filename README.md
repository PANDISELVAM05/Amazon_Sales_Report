# Amazon_Sales_Report
## Project Objective
  The primary objective of this project is to analyze Amazon sales data to uncover patterns and trends in order to:
    Understand product sales performance.
    Identify top-selling and low-performing products.
    Evaluate revenue contributions by product, category, and region.
    Aid in decision-making for inventory planning, marketing strategies, and profit optimization.

##  Questions
To guide the dashboard and analysis, we will address the following questions:
    Which products generate the most revenue?
    What is the monthly trend of total sales and orders?
    Which states or cities contribute the most to overall sales?
    What are the top 5 selling product categories?
    What is the return rate and how does it affect sales?

## Process
The analysis process is divided into the following steps:
  a. Data Cleaning
      Remove null/missing values.
      Correct data types (e.g., dates, prices).
      Handle duplicates if any.
  b. Feature Engineering
      Extract month, year, and day from purchase dates.
      Calculate total revenue per order (Total = Amount * Qty).
      Flag returned orders.
  c. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      Use group-by operations to aggregate sales, quantity, and profit.
      Apply visualization techniques to identify trends and outliers.
  d. Visualization and Dashboard Creation
      Use tools like Excel, Power BI, or Tableau to create:
      Bar charts (Top 10 products)
      Line charts (Monthly sales trend)
      Pie charts (Category-wise distribution)
      Geo maps (State-wise sales)
  
##  Dashboard Features
  The dashboard includes:
      Total Sales Overview: Revenue, Units Sold, Total Orders
      Top Products: Sorted by revenue and quantity sold
      Sales Over Time: Line graph by month and year
      Category Performance: Pie chart or donut chart
      Geographic Sales: Map or bar chart of sales by state/city
      Return Analysis: Number and % of returned items

##  Project Insights
      
  From the analysis, you might discover insights like:
      Certain products (e.g., electronics or accessories) consistently generate high revenue.
      Seasonal peaks in sales (e.g., during festival seasons or holidays).
      Specific states or cities account for a large share of sales.
      Some products have high return rates which could indicate quality issues.
      Discounts or delivery charges significantly affect profitability.

##  Conclusion
  The Amazon sales analysis offers clear visibility into customer buying behavior and product performance. By leveraging the dashboard insights:
      Businesses can optimize inventory management.
      Targeted marketing campaigns can be created for top regions.
      Underperforming products can be reviewed or discontinued.
      Strategic pricing and return policies can be refined.
